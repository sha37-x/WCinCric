        Test cricket stands as the longest and most traditional format of international cricket, played over a maximum of five days with each team having two innings to bat and bowl. Introduced in 1877, Test matches are considered the ultimate test of a team's skill, endurance, and tactical acumen across varying conditions and situations.

The World Test Championship (WTC) was launched by the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2019 to infuse greater context and competitiveness into Test cricket. The championship spans a two-year cycle, with the top nine Test-playing nations (as determined by the ICC rankings) participating. Each team plays six series (three at home and three away) during the cycle, with points awarded based on match results: 120 points for a series win, 60 for a tie, and 30-40 points for a draw, depending on the number of matches in the series.
<br>
<br>
The primary aim of the WTC is to provide a definitive pinnacle event in Test cricket, ensuring every match holds significance beyond just bilateral series. At the end of the league stage, the top two teams compete in a WTC Final held at a neutral venue to determine the champion. The WTC Final is a culmination of the two-year cycle, where the best-performing teams vie for the prestigious title.

The introduction of the WTC has garnered praise for revitalizing Test cricket's stature and viewer interest, as it emphasizes the importance of every Test match in the global context. By providing a structured pathway to a final, the championship adds value to bilateral Test series and encourages teams to approach each match with competitive intent. This format not only rewards consistency and excellence over an extended period but also highlights the timeless allure of Test cricket as the pinnacle of the sport.
